## The Blog

I'm a coding hobbyist and this is my attempt to give some direction to my otherwise aimless wandering between creating an own os or command line tools or doing something in opengl etc. Most of it just me trying out and getting a hang of how things are done. 

| I like ... | because ... |
|---|---|
|C| - I've known it since school days.<BR>- Imperative is true power. <BR>- No headache system programing.|
|C++|- I like cppreference.com browsing.<BR>- The Meta is Magical.<BR>- I've one Windows laptop with Visual Studio in it.|
|Python|- Its best for prototyping ideas.<BR>- ML/AI still haunt any coder's mind.<BR>- I tried to do stuff in Bash Script and it was tedious.|
|Rust|- Like C++ it makes you think different.<BR>- There's tonne of help on the web if you need any.<BR>- 100K+ Crates, all categorized and documented.|
|Linux|- It is my daily driver.<BR>- It can be personalized, heavily.<BR>- **It** *[ with some help from the web ]* **just works ~ Steve Jobs**|
